# NCT_Analysis
This is a project I completed that looks at the failure rates of the NCT.

The Road Safety Authority (RSA) has provided the following information relating to vehicle makes and models tested by the National Car Testing Service in 2016. The main fields, for example, are summarised as follows:
- "VehicleMake" and "VehicleModel" - these fields detail the vehicles make and model
- "YearOfBirth" - this field details the vehicles year.
- "Total" - this field relates to the total NCT's completed by each car model.
- "PASS" and "PASS %" - these fields relate to the total NCT's that by each car model that were successful.
- "FAIL" and "FAIL %" - these fields relate to the total NCT's that by each car model that were unsuccessful.
- The remaining fields were the different items that the vehicles failed on.
Overall this is a broad dataset with a variety of information about the Vehicles which have been tested by the NCT.

The aim of this project was to gain an insight into this data and producing three effective visualisations using Vega-Lite. More information can be found about Vega-Lite here: https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/.
These visualisations are implemented and explained fully in the HTML files provided in this repo.

The **first** visualisation I created shows the relationship between the mean pass percentage of vehicles and the total NCT's completed in the respective year.

The **second** visualisation I created shows the relationship between the mean pass percentage rate and each unique Vehicle Make.

My **third** visualisation aims to get an insight into whether there is a relationship between the trend of the three most frequent Fail Items and the Year of the most popular Vehicles.
